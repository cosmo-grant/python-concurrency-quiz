# README

## What is this?

A quiz about Python concurrency.
A practice project.
A bit of fun.

## What does it cover?

Multithreading, multiprocessing, asyncio.
The fundamental concepts, not the high-level APIs.
As of 3.14, with the GIL.

## But it doesn't cover xyz!

It focuses on the fundamentals.
And no one wants a 50 question quiz.

## Did you use LLMs?

I used Opus 4.5 in OpenCode for styling.
Transcripts in `transcripts/`.
I wrote everything else, following the example of [fstrings-wtf](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/fstrings-wtf/).

## Don't the outputs depend on the machine?

Yes.
Whether it's single- or multi-core.
Whether it's fast or slow.
Whether it's busy or idle.
Whether the power cuts out mid-execution.
And more.

Some snippets have comments asking you to make this or that assumption.
Otherwise assume a typical modern machine under normal conditions.
I checked all the snippets on a MacBook Pro M3.

## How did you check the snippets?

Using [snippet-checker](https://github.com/cosmo-grant/snippet-checker).
