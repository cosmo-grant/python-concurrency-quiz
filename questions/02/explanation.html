<p>A thread runs only when it holds the Global Interpreter Lock.</p>

<p>
  The running thread is paused regularly, or when it makes a syscall, and a
  ready thread gets the GIL and runs. Interleaved, not parallel.
</p>

<p>
  Thus: when <code>thread1</code> and <code>thread2</code> sleep, the main
  thread runs.
