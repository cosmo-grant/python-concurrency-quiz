There are three threads in play: main, <code>thread1</code>,
<code>thread2</code>.<br />
<br />
The interpreter pauses the running thread regularly, releasing the GIL, and the
OS decides which to run next.<br />
<br />
<code>thread1</code> and <code>thread2</code> are CPU-bound, so interleaving
doesn't help.
